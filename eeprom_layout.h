*EEPROM Map. There is support for up to 6 devices: A motor controller, display, charger, BMS, Throttle,  and a misc device (EPAS, WOC, etc)
* 
*There is a 256KB eeprom chip which stores these settings. The 4K is allocated to primary storage and 4K is allocated to a "known good"
* storage location. This leaves most of EEPROM free for something else, probably logging.

The device table is just a list of IDs. The devices register for a spot in the table.
Since each device has a 16 bit ID and the reserved space is 128 bytes we can support
64 different devices in the table and EEPROM
Devices are considered enabled if their highest ID bit is set (0x8000) otherwise
they're disabled.
This means that valid IDs must be under 0x8000 but that still leaves a couple of open IDs ;)
First device entry is 0xDEAD if valid - otherwise table is initialized
